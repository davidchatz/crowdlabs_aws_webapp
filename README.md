# Crowdsourced hands-on lab for a web application on AWS

## High Level Goals
* **Hands-On**: Provide a hands-on lab that allows people to apply their knowledge beyond certificate-based AWS courses
* **Crowdsource**: Encourage ideas and contributions from the community on how best to approach and implement aspects of an environment on AWS
* **Broad**: Explore the use of both long standing and new AWS products and features

## Approach and Collaboration
* Each *course* is a set of *labs* that work towards a defined goal
* Each lab should define the environment state it expects and the resulting state 
* The labs should continue to work together

### Optionally
* A lab could have different *styles* that use different tools to achieve the same outcome. For example
  * using the console,
  * a cloudformation stack,
  * a terraform (or other tool) stack,
  * the cli commands 
* The labs could have different *variants* that take a different approach
  * Where the variants result in a vastly different incompatible state, the course may need to fork down different path or be a separate course
  * Forks should be minimised
